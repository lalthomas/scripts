  I. What is it?
    
    HTML2TEXT is a utility that converts HTML files to plain text. Optionally
    it also tries to figure out if the HTML file is well-constructed.

  III. General information
    
    This documentation is written in HTML format in way that it is readable in
    a text viewer as good as possible and as long as the HTML format allows
    it. A to-text-converted version is also included.
    
    All my documentations are, since about June 1997, written in HTML. Prior
    to that date they were written in plain text. This means a) that I can put
    them on the big web, b) they're readable at all time and c) at all
    machines that have a browser for it and d) they're easily converted to
    other formats, such as Postscript, Wordperfect and of course plain-text e)
    I can easily make formatted documentations.
    
    Any bugs, errors, suggestions, thought, ideas, etc should be sent to the
    author, these also includes errors in the documentation. Also the
    existence of not supported HTML-tags or entity sequences can be sent to  [
     mailto:wieger1@bart.nl ] the author, along with a description,
    restrictions and options. No matter how puny or important your help is, I
    need your help to improve this program. 
    If you want to become a beta tester of this program contact  [ 
    mailto:wieger1@bart.nl ] me and I'll send you the details. Unfortunately I
    cannot give rewards other then gratitude.
    
    You are encouraged to register this piece of software. This means that you
    will either receive the latest version when it is released or a note that
    a new version is released. It also gives me an idea about how many people
    use this program and how it's spread. The information provided to register
    will not be used for other purpose then HTML2TEXT and by any other persons
    other then me.
    There are three ways to register: 
      i. Start your web-browser and fill in the  [ 
        http://www.bart.nl/~wieger1/register.htm ] form. 
      ii. Convert register.htm to a text file, edit it to fill in the
        entries and email it to me. 
      iii. Same as above but print it and send it to my postal address. 
    Be sure to enter the correct email address on the form! If not I might not
    be able to send you the registration key.
    
    Note that registration is Free of charge!
    
    When you're registered you will become a private registration key, so that
    your name is written when you execute the program instead of Unregistered.
    However no other function will be available in the registered version. In
    other words the unregistered version is not crippled This file will be
    sent via email if possible. This is currently the only way to receive the
    registration key. When you order (see below) you will automatically be
    registered and the key can be found on the disk.
    
    
  IV. Which files are contained in the package?
    
    
    HTML2TXT.EXE  The executable.                                           
    HTML2TXT.CFG  Configuration file with options.                          
    HTML2TXT.INI  Ini-file with entity references.                          
    HTML2TXT.HTM  Documentation for HTML2TEXT in HTML format.               
    HTML2TXT.TXT  Documentation for HTML2TEXT in plain text format.         
    REGISTER.HTM  Registration form in HTML format.                         
    LONGFILE.BTM  4DOS batch file to convert HTML files which does support  
                  Windows 95 long filenames.                                
    
    If one of the files is missing, throw the package away and ask the author
    for a new and complete copy. The address is at the end of the file.
    
    
  V. What does it do?
    
    HTML2TEXT converts HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML) files to plain-text
    (ASCII) files. The following rules are applies for this: 
      * The title is optionally displayed on the first line of the output
        file. Optionally the complete filename plus path are written too. 
      * Entity references (&...;) are converted to character sequences
        according to the input file or pre-programmed characters. 
      * Any tags will perform the task according to the HTML specification
        as good as possible, note that some tags cannot have any output in
        plain ASCII text files (eg. blinking, fonts, colours). 
      * Newlines and tabs are converted to spaces and are removed if
        obsolete, as are spaces. 
      * Lines are written and justified according to settings, lines are
        wrapped by words when they are too long. Word delimiters are
        user-definable. 
      * Tables are reformatted and forms are output so that they can be
        filled in after conversion. The output of forms is highly
        user-specifiable. 
      * Warnings are generated on ill-constructed tags or entity references.
        
    
    
  VI. How to start it?
    
    A quick start instruction is to type on the commandline:
      HTML2TXT file.htm
    This will convert the file "file.htm" to "file.txt".
    
    The full syntax of HTML2TEXT is:
    
      HTML2TXT <filespecification> @<listfile> <options>
    
    <Filespecification> is the name of the files to convert, it may include
    wildcards (* and ?). More than one file specification may appear on the
    command line. Note that long filenames (Windows 95/NT) are not supported.
    This means that input filenames have to be of the 8.3 format (Every W95/NT
    file has a 8.3 filename and optionally a long filename). The output will
    always be a 8.3 filename. 4DOS users (v5.5+) can use the %@SFN[...]
    function to get the short filename of a long filename (see 4DOS
    documentation for details). A 4DOS batch file is also included to perform
    conversion of files with long filenames, see below. Windows 95 users can
    drag and drop files to the executable, Windows then uses the short
    filename anyway.
    
    @<listfile> is a name of a file that contains the names of files to
    convert. The <listfile> may not contain wildcards. Each of these filenames
    must appear on a single line. Empty lines are permitted and files may have
    leading or trailing whitespace characters. The names of these files have
    the same restrictions as the files from the <filespecification>. You
    cannot use options in a listfile.
    
    <options> can be the following:
    
    -a-         Do not display text for links.                              
    -A          Do not display links, images and forms                      
    -b-         Do not mark bold text.                                      
    -b+         Mark bold text by embracing it with stars (*).              
    -b:<chars>  Specifies the two characters used to mark bold text.        
                Exactly two characters have to be given.                    
    -B-         Don't print borders for tables.                             
    -B:<num>    Use predefined border <num>, where <num> is                 
                  1. 7 bit ASCII (using -|+)                                
                  2. Single lines                                           
                  3. Double lines                                           
                  4. Double horizontal lines and single vertical lines      
                  5. Single horizontal lines and double vertical lines      
                  6. Single frame only                                      
                  7. Double frame only                                      
                  8. Double frame, single cell separators                   
                  9. Single frame, double cell separators                   
                For a graphical example of those tables look at the config  
                file.                                                       
    -c          Automatically create directory when the specified output    
                path does not exist.                                        
    -c-         Ask to create when the specified output path does not       
                exist.                                                      
    -C:<num>    Sets the charset to use. <num> can be any number from 1 to  
                9. By default one is chosen, except when windows is         
                detected (in enhanced mode, but who cares) then the         
                default is 3.                                               
                1 : ASCII (7 bit)                                           
                2 : Extended ASCII (8 bit)

    -D          Show hidden input fields as normal text fields.             
    -D-         Hide hidden input fields.                                   
    -e          Fast conversion. Equals the options I-ha-F-w-t-O-N-         
                It doesn't always look real nice, but fast it is.           
    -E-         Do not read the ini file and thus not convert any entity    
                references, except of the form                              
    -f          Get input from standard input, then read the files          
                specified. Input from standard input will be converted and  
                then output to standard output.                             
    -f-         Only read the files specified.                              
    -F-         Do not display input fields in forms.

    -H-         Continue after reading </html>.                             
    -i-         Do not mark italic text.                                    
    -i+         Mark italic text by embracing it with slashes (/).

    -q-         Treat balancing of quotes relaxed. A '>' always ends a      
                tag.                                                        
    -r          Print lists of roman type as ordinary numbers.

    -s-         Files will be used for output, the output filename will be  
                derived from the output path and the filename entered.      
    -S          Stretch tables to the full width of the page. This looks    
                neat when you've more short tables with similar data.       
    -S-         Do not stretch tables to the full width of the page. The    
                width of the table is the minimum width required.

    -u-         Do not mark underlined text.                                
    -u+         Mark underlined text by embracing it with underscores (_).  
    -u:<chars>  Specifies the two characters used to mark underlined text.  
                Exactly two characters have to be given.                    
    -v          Display version info.                                       
    -w          Warn for HTML-errors in the source file.                    
    -w-         Do not warn for HTML-errors in the source file.             
    -W:<num>    Set the line length to <num>. Maximum line length is 255.   
    -W-         No line wrapping will be performed.                         
    -W          Set line length to the screenwidth (usually 80).            
    -y-         Do not use hyphenation.                                     
    -?          Displays short a help.                                      
    
    I know the program suffers from creeping featuritis!

    Most options are different from the options of the version before version
    1.50 of HTML2TEXT. This was necessary to maintain some logic in the naming
    of the options, which have increased immensely in number. Otherwise the
    characters used would be quite cryptic. Please read the section above
    carefully. And options are now case-sensitive.
    
    You can concatenate options to save space. Except -O:<File> which must be
    the last. Better use the config file to set this variable.
    
    The result file will have the same name as the original file, but with the
    extension specified in the config-file (default is .txt), unless the
    original extension was the same as the extension of the output file, then
    the extension will be `.tx1' (always).
    
    All messages are written to standard error, unless hush is set. 4DOS users
    can also redirect standard error or use the Windows clipboard by the
    device `clip:'.
    
    
  VII. Can I use another way to specify options?
    
    Yes, you can. There are two other ways to specify the options. First of
    all you can use the HTML2TXT.CFG file (see next section). And second you
    can use the environment variable H2T_SW. You can set all options in this
    variable.
     Eg. set H2T_SW=-b-u-T2
    will switch marking of underlined text and bold text off and switch the
    title to setting 2. The leading `-' can be omitted. 
    
    
  VIII. What do the files HTML2TXT.INI & HTML2TXT.CFG do?
    
    
      * HTML2TXT.INI
        
        This file contains the translation table for ampersand sequences also
        known as entity references, ie. a sequence of characters of the form:
        &some_text;. The lines are of following format: 
        <identifier>="<result>" 
        Where the <identifier> is the text between the `&' and the `;'.
        <result> is the text that will replace entity reference. The quotes
        are optional. The text can contain escape sequences (C-style) of the
        format \<char> where <char> can be: 
          # s : a space 
          # n : a newline 
        
        Or of the format \<number> then the character which ASCII value equals
        <number> is inserted. Every other character is literally insert,
        including quotes and bashes.
        
        entity references of the format &#nnn; not specified in the
        config-file will be converted to the ASCII value nnn, as are entity
        references of the format &#xnn;, the hexadecimal representation.
        
        
      * HTML2TXT.CFG 
        
        This file contains the various options that can be set. These are all
        eloquently commented in the file itself. So take a peek at that file.
        
        Beware that some options have side effects, eg. turning off line
        wrapping means also that text will not be centered.
        
        In both files any line starting with a semicolon (;) is treated as
        comments and thus ignored. In the config-file lines starting with a
        double cross (#) are also treated as comments.
        
        Both files will be sought for in the current directory first and then
        the directory from where HTML2TEXT was started. Usually these files
        will be placed in the same directory as HTML2TXT.EXE, a directory in
        your path. The path to ini-file can also be specified in the
        config-file, if so it will be sought there first.
        
        
  IX. What is the order of reading options?
    
    When HTML2TEXT starts all options are set to the default value. Then the
    HTML2TXT.CFG file is read. Next the environment variable H2T_SW is read
    and finally the commandline options are read. This means that any
    redefining of options will overwrite the previous settings.
    
    
  X. Which tags does it recognise?

    These are all the tags from the HTML-specification version 4.0. Not all
    are currently fully implemented although most are. Also included are some
    browser specific tags, for either Netscape as Microsoft Internet Exploder.
    The full specification of HTML can be found  [  www.w3.org ] here.
    
    Here Checks means that for every open tag a matching closing tag is
    sought. In most cases the order of the closing tags are not relevant, but
    sometimes the output will be unexpected when tags are closed in the wrong
    order.
    
    Here Ignores means that the tag is just ignored, no output is generated
    and no checks are performed. Mostly these will be tag that set options to
    the output that have no meaning in plain text files. What would a client
    side map, for example do in a text file?
    
    Some tags may have optional closing tags, these are ignored and not
    checked. Eg. <tr>,<td>,<th>,<p>. Changed from previous versions is that
    the anchor tag (<a ...>) now always needs a closing tag, although for most
    name definitions these are usually left out. Some of those tags need a
    closing tag (preceded by a slash), these will be checked, if the tag was
    opened before. It will also be checked if those tags are closed in the
    right order. Furthermore is checked that tags are not nested if not
    necessary (eg. bold), this might indicate a missing slash in the tag in
    the second tag. Lots of tags are simply ignored and thus generate no
    output. Some tags optionally generate output. Any text after </html> is
    optionally ignored. Mainly to prevent garbage output. Some tags cause the
    following text to be ignored until a closing tag appears.
    
    Unknown tags are ignored and optionally a message is generated.
    
    Note that this just specifies the actions taken by HTML2TEXT and not what
    the HTML specification says about tags, however I have tried to implement
    the tags close to the specification as possible.
    
    Tables generate the following output. Every table row is written on at
    least one line, and every row yields a linefeed. Table columns are
    separated by at least one space or other cell separator. Some options are
    implemented for tables, but currently do not all work very well, a row can
    only be affected by at most one rowspan and one colspan. Also text won't
    be stretched to the full length of cells with rowspans, the cells below
    will be empty instead. Colspan is currently implemented, the content of
    the cells will be stretched of the number of columns according to the
    collspan. Tables are squeezed to a minimum size or strectched to the full
    width, if linewrap is chosen. Otherwise a cell will be of the length of
    the longest cell in the column. The squeezing and stretching of cells is
    done is quite a rough fashion. For long tables check out the config-file
    to set some parameters so that those are handled well too (who uses tables
    larger than 256 x 10 with cells of more than 64 KB, however some people
    build their whole pages in a table...). if you do you will have to
    increase the max_rows and the max_cols in the config-file. If this is
    necessary the most likely error messages are error 13 and error 14. Also
    possible are error 7 and error 12. Except for error 12 these errors are
    fatal errors. Occasionally this may also lead a situation in which your
    machine seems not to respond. Too long cells, ie larger than 64k will be
    truncated.
    Nested tables aren't supported either, those will be treated as if the
    notables option is set to on. Only the outer-table will be formatted.
    
    
  XI. What does it output?
    
    HTML2TEXT can have two kinds of output: 
      1. It can just throw all output to standard output. This means that
        all files specified are concatenated to stdout. This also means that
        one can `pipe' or redirect the output directly.
        
        
      2. It can create files with extension specified in the config-file (or
        `tx1' in case the input has that extension). If the output already
        exists, the user is asked to confirm overwriting of the file.
        
        
    Note that all messages are written to standard error. This is because one
    needs to make a distinction between the converted text and the additional
    info output by HTML2TEXT. Thus any messages are written to the screen even
    if stdout is redirected. Standard error can be redirected as well btw
    (however command.com does not support it). Also the hush option will
    prevent output to stderr.
    
    When the output path specified in the config file does not exist, by
    default, the user is asked whether the path should be created. When the
    answer is no or the creation did not succeed the current path is used.
    
    HTML2TEXT sometimes uses temporary files to store data. These are of the
    format H2T_xxxx.$$$. where the xxxx stands for a number. Those files can
    safely be deleted after using HTML2TEXT. Most of the time the program
    handles that itself. However the files are not deleted on fatal errors or
    user interruptions.
    
    
  XII. How does it get input?
    
    HTML2TEXT can get input from two sources. First it can read files
    specified on the commandline, wildcards are permitted and from the
    listfile. Secondly the input can be derived from the console. In other
    words input can be redirected from standard input. Use the -f option to
    set redirection on. If no filename is specified, it expects input from
    standard input too. This means that programmes can `pipe' their output to
    HTML2TEXT and also input can be redirected from files. Eg. 
      type myhtml.htm | html2txt -f
    This means that type will output the myhtml.htm file to stdout and it will
    be `piped' to HTML2TXT. Practically this way will have the same effect as
     HTML2TXT myhtml.htm -s
    The output from redirection from standard input will always be sent to
    standard output, that means that if it has to be sent to a file,
    redirection has to be used again. Eg. 
      type myhtml.htm | html2txt -f > myhtml.txt
    Now the output will be written to a file called myhtml.txt.
    If files are specified on the command line as well, the output will still
    depend on the standard_output parameter.
    For usage of redirection and `piping' check the manuals of the commandline
    interpreter (eg. command.com or 4dos.com).
    
    
  XIII. What is printed in the log files?
    
    The log file contains for each file it converts the full path of the input
    file and the full path of the output file. In addition to that the date
    and time will be printed. When standard input or output is used <stdin>
    and <stdout> will be printed instead. Also it contains all output written
    to the screen during conversion. However each line will be preceded by two
    double crosses (`#').

  XV. What does LONGFILE.BTM do?
    
    LONGFILE.BTM is a simple 4DOS batch file that uses HTML2TEXT to convert
    HTML-files to TEXT-files. This file will use Windows 95 long filenames.
    However this batch file has some limitations. 
      * Existing files will always be overwritten. 
      * Extension of the ouput file will always be .txt. 
      * No output to the screen is generated, such as error, warning etc. 
      * It needs 4DOS 6.00 or better to run (maybe 4DOS 5.5 works too). 
    There is no guarantee or whatsoever that this program will work correctly
    or even something near that. It has been tested very little and is
    probably error infested, when using commandline options. Use it at your
    own reponsibility. Further you are encouraged to improve the working of
    the batch file and send those versions to me.
    
    
    Usage: 
      LONGFILE.BTM <filespecification>
    Where <filespecification> is the name of the file you want to convert.
    Wildcards are permitted and you can have multiple file specification on a
    line.
    
    Use this batch file at your own risk! It is not well tested. Future
    edition will probably have more advanced methods of using W95 long
    filenames. The source code is included, however, so that one can
    experiment with it a little.
    
    
  XVI. Why does it output look weird sometimes?
    
    Some people misuse HTML tags. For example <pre>...</pre> sections are used
    to insert newlines in the output. Or tables are used to define the layout
    of a whole page. In graphical browser, such as Netscape, this may lead to
    the intended result. However in a text-based system this may lead to large
    gaps of newlines and empty sections. And of course small columns with
    useful information.This is not a bug in HTML2TEXT but usually a result of
    lousy written HTML-codes, since HTML2TEXT tries to conform to the
    specification as good as possible. Most of the authors of such pages do
    not even bother to try and understand the HTML specs. 
    
    Other `weird things' happen when some one writes something similar to the
    following fragment of HTML-code:
     Some text and<b> this </b>is very important.
    This would like like in the out as:
     Some text and* this *is very important.
    The spaces are at the `wrong' side of `*'. This is just what is done by
    the program (This probably is what Netscape does too but you cannot see it
    (or are the spaces slightly wider?)). The spaces are made bold too. Do
    remember that most tags are not word delimiters. Some are tho treated that
    way, such as <br> and <p>.
    
    One final word about weird output. The program does not remove trailing
    spaces. Mostly this is not necessary. But if it is necessary you'll have
    to do it yourself. Most good editors however have an option to remove
    these. Also there are filters enough that can handle it. The reason why
    the trailing spaces are not removed is that it will degrade performance
    drastically.
    
    
  XVII. The program works so slow what happened?
    
    In most cases the program does work quite fast. However on an older
    machine it may be that it runs quite slow. Mostly this is due to
    conversion of tables which takes quite some time. Anyway here are some
    hints to make it run faster (some are quite obvious):
    
      * Run the program in DOS not in windoze mode. Especially windoze DOS
        boxes are terribly slow. Also full screen DOS mode is slower than real
        DOS mode. 
      * Use diskcaches to speed up reading and writing data. Even though
        HTML2TEXT uses buffers for reading and writing. 
      * Use a ramdrive for working directory. This will speed up conversion
        of tables. Be sure however to have enough space free. 
      * Removes any comment or empty lines from both the ini and config
        files and remove lines that are set to default values from the config
        file. 
      * Remove any lines of entity references from the ini-file that you
        will not use. And lines starting with a double cross (`#') that are
        converted to the ASCII value. 
      * Switch notables on. This converts tables quicker but uglier. 
      * Turn warnings off. This slightly increases speed. 
      * Disable printing of links, anchors, images and input. These can be
        somewhat time consuming. Since the texts need to be parsed. 
    
  XVIII. What's with those version numbers
    
    Version numbers are defined into several sections.
    In the first place there is a major version number, 1 currently. Which is
    followed by a dot. Then there is the minor version number, 50 now. The
    version is followed by a single character. `a' is a alpha release which is
    never released, only for my usage, lots of new functions have to be
    implemented or finished still. `b' is the beta release and most likely the
    normal release, since this version would not change much more, except for
    some bug fixes. `c' will denote an updated version from the beta release.
    Then there are internal revision. This number will be increased as changes
    are implemented each time. Plus a data of last editing will be entered (in
    Frisian). This date should be the same as the date that your operating
    system returns.
    
    
  XIX. Problems & Open Issues
    
    
      * Forms
        Forms may look a bit silly when they are wider than the maximum width
        of a line, especially within tables.
        
        
      * Tables
        Tables are reformatted in a rather simplified manner (see above)
        Future editions will have improved table processing.
        Large tables may produce erroneous output (one cell may not contain
        more than 65k bytes the rest is truncated). Too many columns in a
        table will terminate the program.
        
        
      * Too many newline
        Some combinations of tags will result in too many newlines. However
        most of those are fixed now.
        
        
  XX. How to obtain a new copy of HTML2TEXT?
    
    There are several ways to obtain a copy of html2text: 
      1. Download it here:  [  http://www.noord.bart.nl/~wieger1/h2t150b.zip
        ] http://www.noord.bart.nl/~wieger1/h2t150b.zip
        
        
      2. Write an email to me and ask. I will return the latest copy
        attached to the reply as zipped archive.
        
        
      3. Write to my postal address and ask. Be sure to include enough
        (Dutch! no other currency will be accepted) money to cover the
        postage. Also include the return address. For Dutch return addresses
        include a SASE (with enough postage for a diskette). Only 3.5"
        diskettes will be used.
        
        
      4. Look at the nearest BBS or Internet site, for a copy. It is
        uploaded to Simtel usually.
        
        
  XXI. Is this program ported to other platforms?
    
    No, not yet. Currently it only works is DOS (3.3 or better). It should
    work in Windows and OS/2 DOS boxes. It should also work with most DOS
    emulators on other platforms.
    
    
  XXII. What's left do work out?
    
    
      * Better table formatting, include options of alignment, rowspan also
        alignment on caption isn't supported well. 
      * Windows 95 long filenames. 
      * Extend support for character sets. Eg. table borders and char set 1
        do not accept non 7 bit ASCII characters. 
      * Ports to other platforms, such as various Unix variants and
        Macintosh. 
      * Lots of small things 
    
  XXIII. What changes were made?
    
    1.51                                                                    
             * Fixed a bug, when one of the format string was empty,        
           causing to print random data.                                    
             * Fixed a bug, ignoring the first entity reference, of a       
           certain length.                                                  
             * Fixed a small bug when reading escape character for          
           input_fill_char                                                  
             * Increased customisability for format strings.

             * Added the possibility to feed options through the config     
           file.

             * Added support for multiple character sets for the entity     
           references.                                                      
             * Redefined options, options are now case-sensitive too.       
             * Optionally get rid of the `-=' and `=-' from the title.      
             * Added customisability of displaying input, image and link    
           tags.                                                            
             * Added possibility to specify an output path.                 
             * Added support for single and double quote for string         
           enclosing within tags.                                           
             * Added many new tags from HTML 4.0 Specification.             
             * Re-wrote the larger part of this documentation.              
             * Fixed a couple of bugs in generating warnings.               
             * Fixed a bug in expanding wildcards. It doesn't expand        
           directories anymore.                                             
             * Many smaller bugs fixed.                                     
             * Many small cosmetic changes.

             * Now word delimiters besides spaces and tabs and newlines,    
           etc can be defined.                                              
             * Added borders for tables and implemented the colspan         
           attribute.                                                       
             * The entity references in tag attributes will be converted.   
                                                                            
    1.21.                                                                   
             * Redirection of input from standard input, is the default

    1.20

             * Line wrapping added internally (WORDWRAP.EXE is not          
           necessary anymore).                                              
             * Option added to set line wrap.                               
             * WORDWRAP package not included anymore.                       
             * Amp sequences of the format &#nnn; can now be defined, but   
           can be ignored.                                                  
             * A very nasty bug fixed which corrupted the heap.

             * Fixed a nasty bug, when outputting to STDOUT, the number of  
           errors was displayed before the last text.                       
             * More intelligent algorithm for performing simple text.       
             * Added value and type options to <LI> tag.                    
             * Added option for title.                                      
             * Decreased default value for stack and tag size.              
             * Documentation converted to HTML format.                      
                                                                            
    1.00                                                                    
             * First version, not released
